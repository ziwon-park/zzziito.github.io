This project involved developing a crucial communication module for the ARC multi-robot intelligence system. The module enabled seamless data transmission and reception, facilitating the integration of third-party robots. Key features included real-time transfer of localization data from ARC Eye to the central server and efficient exchange of robot status information. The work focused on optimizing data flow to ensure low-latency and high-reliability communication, enhancing the overall performance of the ARC system's multi-robot coordination capabilities.
