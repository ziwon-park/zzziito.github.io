abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have successfully classified EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. However, recent studies have found that well-designed input samples, known as adversarial examples, can easily fool well-performed deep neural networks model with minor perturbations undetectable by a human. This paper proposes an efficient generative model named generative perturbation network (GPN), which can generate universal adversarial examples with the same architecture for non-targeted and targeted attacks. Furthermore, the proposed model can be efficiently extended to conditionally or simultaneously generate perturbations for various targets and victim models. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that perturbations generated by the proposed model outperform previous approaches for crafting signal-agnostic perturbations. We demonstrate that the extended network for signal-specific methods also significantly reduces generation time while performing similarly. The transferability across classification networks of the proposed method is superior to the other methods, which shows our perturbations' high level of generality.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This paper introduces the generative perturbation network (GPN), an efficient model for generating universal adversarial examples in EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. GPN can produce perturbations capable of fooling deep neural networks with minor undetectable changes, and it outperforms previous methods in crafting signal-agnostic perturbations. Additionally, GPN can efficiently generate perturbations for various targets and victim models, demonstrating high transferability across classification networks.
