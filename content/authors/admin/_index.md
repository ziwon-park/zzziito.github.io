I am a Ph.D. student at the [Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Lab.](http://airlab.khu.ac.kr), Department of Software Convergence, Kyung Hee University, Republic of Korea. 
I study visual perception using deep neural representation. 
I received B.S. degree in the Department of Software at Gachon University in 2022 and M.S. degree in the Department of Software Convergence at Kyung Hee University in 2024. 
My research interest includes Computer Vision, Deep Representation Learning, and Model Compression. 
Recently, I focus on model compression in the perspective of redundant representation of neural networks.
